## Day 1: Date Picker
Tried using the native input: [https://reactnative.dev/docs/handling-text-input] and found it doesn't handle dates:
```
<TextInput type="date" > // does not work
```

So you follow react-native's advice and must reach for a library:

Tried packages from here: https://reactnative.directory/?search=datepicker
including:
* `react-native-ui-datepicker` - seems to work
* ~~~`react-native-datepicker`~~~ did not work (react-native-datetimepicker openly needs community help)

## Day 2: Page Transitions
